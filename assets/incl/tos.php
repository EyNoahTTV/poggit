  <ol start="1">
    <li>not to reproduce, duplicate, copy or resell any part of the Site in contravention of the
      provisions of our terms of website use;

    <li><h3>INTERACTIVE SERVICES</h3></li>
  </ol>
  <ol start="1">
    <li>We may from time to time provide interactive services on the Site, including, without
      limitation:
    </li>
  </ol>
  <ol start="1">
    <li>chat rooms;</li>
    <li>bulletin boards;</li>
    <li>reviews</li>
  </ol>
  <p>(the "Interactive Services").</p>
  <ol start="2">
    <li>Where we do provide any Interactive Services, we will provide clear information to you about the
      kind of service offered, if it is moderated and what form of moderation is used (including
      whether it is human or technical).
    </li>
    <li>We will do our best to assess any possible risks for users (and in particular, for children)
      from third parties when they use any Interactive Services provided on the Site, and we will
      decide in each case whether it is appropriate to use moderation of the relevant service
      (including what kind of moderation to use) in the light of those risks. However, we are under no
      obligation to oversee, monitor or moderate any Interactive Services we provide on the Site, and
      we expressly exclude our liability for any loss or damage arising from the use of any
      Interactive Services by a user in contravention of our content standards, whether the service is
      moderated or not.
    </li>
    <li>The use of any of our Interactive Services by a minor is subject to the consent of their parent
      or guardian. We advise parents who permit their children to use the Interactive Services that it
      is important that they communicate with their children about their safety online, as moderation
      is not foolproof. Minors who are using any Interactive Services should be made aware of the
      potential risks to them.
    </li>
    <li>Where we do moderate any Interactive Services, we will normally provide you with a means of
      contacting the moderator, should a concern or difficulty arise.
